# APIs Introduction with .NET and Entity Framework
In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of building an API using the WEB API template in .NET and Entity Framework. We will cover the following topics:

- What is an API?
- WEB API template
- HTTP verbs
- Route attribute
- Middleware concept
- Dependencies Injection
- Logging
- Swagger
- Connecting with PostgreSQL
- Testing with Postman

## What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that enables different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs are used to create an interface for a web application or a web service that can be used by other applications.
## WEB API template
The WEB API template in .NET is used to build RESTful APIs. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is a style of architecture for building web services. With the WEB API template, we can quickly create an API that can accept HTTP requests and respond with JSON data.

## HTTP verbs
HTTP verbs are used to define the type of operation that is being performed on a resource. The most common HTTP verbs are:

- GET: Used to retrieve data from the server.
- POST: Used to submit data to the server.
- PUT: Used to update data on the server.
- DELETE: Used to delete data from the server.

## Route attribute
The Route attribute is used to define the URL pattern for a specific action in the API controller. It is used to map the HTTP requests to the correct action in the controller.

## Middleware concept
Middleware is a software layer that sits between the client and the server. It is used to handle different types of requests and responses. Middleware can be used to add security, logging, and other features to an API.

## Dependencies Injection
Dependency Injection is a design pattern that is used to inject dependencies into an object. It is used to make the code more testable and easier to maintain.

## LoggingLogging
Logging is the process of recording events that occur in an application. It is used to track errors, monitor performance, and provide feedback to the users.

## SwaggerSwagger
Swagger is an open-source tool that is used to create API documentation. It is used to describe the API endpoints, the HTTP methods, and the response types.

## Connecting with PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used to store data for web applications. In this tutorial, we will learn how to connect our API with a PostgreSQL database.

## Testing with Postman
Postman is a popular tool that is used to test APIs. It is used to send HTTP requests and receive responses from an API. We will use Postman to test our API and ensure that it is working correctly.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned the basics of building an API using the WEB API template in .NET and Entity Framework. We covered the HTTP verbs, the Route attribute, middleware concept, dependencies injection, logging, Swagger, connecting with PostgreSQL, and testing with Postman. We hope that this tutorial has been helpful in understanding the fundamentals of building an API.
